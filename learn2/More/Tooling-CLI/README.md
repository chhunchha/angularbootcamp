# Angular CLI

https://cli.angular.io/

https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

The official Angular CLI is the best choice to use as you are getting
started with Angular development. We also have other examples here
(some of them not updated since the angular beta series) that show
that other tooling choices are possible.

The CLI is covered in depth during the main body of the class, but
here are extra pieces that may be useful for advanced students.

## Lazy loading and aot

Here is an example published by Angular guru Brandon Roberts, which
shows (as of September 2016, before CLI has direct easy, support for
these things) how to use both ahead of time compilation and lazy route
loading, in the context of a CLI application.
